To analyze the mouse movement data, we define the following features:

1. Speed: Ratio of distance between two consecutive points and the time taken.
2. Mean Speed: Average speed
3. Direction: For any two consecutive recorded points A and B, the direction is defined as the angle between that line and the horizontal.
4. Mean Direction: Average Direction
5. Angle of Curvature: For any three consecutive recorded points A, B, and C, the angle of curvature is angle between the line from A to B and the line from B to C.
6. Mean Angle of Curvature: Average Angle of Curvature
7. Curvature Distance: For any three recorded points A, B, and C, the curvature distance is the ratio of the perpendicular distance from point B to line AC to the length of AC
8. Mean Curvature Distance: Average Curvature Distance
9. Average Clicks: Total number of clicks divide by the total time spent
10. Drag Time: Time spent dragging the mouse
11. MeanX: Mean value of the x-coordinate
12. MeanY: Mean value of the y-coordinate
