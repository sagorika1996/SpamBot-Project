To analyze the mouse movement data, we define the following features:

1. Speed (speed): Ratio of distance between two consecutive points and the time taken.
2. Mean Speed (meanSpeed): Average speed
3. Direction (dir): For any two consecutive recorded points A and B, the direction is defined as the angle between that line and the horizontal.
4. Mean Direction (meadDir): Average Direction
5. Angle of Curvature (cAng): For any three consecutive recorded points A, B, and C, the angle of curvature is angle between the line from A to B and the line from B to C.
6. Mean Angle of Curvature (meanCAng): Average Angle of Curvature
7. Curvature Distance (cDist): For any three recorded points A, B, and C, the curvature distance is the ratio of the perpendicular distance from point B to line AC to the length of AC
8. Mean Curvature Distance (meanCDist): Average Curvature Distance
9. Average Clicks (avgClicks): Total number of clicks divide by the total time spent
10. Drag Time (dragTime): Time spent dragging the mouse
11. MeanX (meanX): Mean value of the x-coordinate
12. MeanY (meanY): Mean value of the y-coordinate
